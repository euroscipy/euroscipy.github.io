<h2><span class="caps">CEILS</span>: Counterfactual Explanations as Interventions in Latent&nbsp;Space</h2>
<p><em>Riccardo Crupi, Alessandro, daniele&nbsp;regoli</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the Machine Learning context, Counterfactual Explanations as Interventions in Latent Space (<span class="caps">CEILS</span>) is an Explainable <span class="caps">AI</span> (<span class="caps">XAI</span>) methodology to generate counterfactual explanations capturing by design the underlying causal relations between the variables at hand, and at the same time to provide feasible recommendations to reach the proposed profile. For instance, in a problem of loan granting you may be interested in the action to put in place in order to change a rejection decision. Moreover, there are features like the credit score, very important for the final decision, that are not directly actionable, but can change in response to changes in other (actionable) variables, such as income, bank seniority, etc. <span class="caps">CEILS</span>, by taking into account this causal impact among variables, makes it possible to provide actions on actionable features only, but nevertheless leveraging their impact on the other variables to eventually reach the desired counterfactual&nbsp;outcome.</p>

<h2>BioConvert: a comprehensive format converter for life&nbsp;sciences</h2>
<p><em>thomas&nbsp;cokelaer</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Life science uses many different formats. They may be old, or with complex syntax and converting these formats may be challenging for scientists. Bioconvert aims to provide a standard tool/interface to convert life science data formats from one to&nbsp;another.</p>
<p>Many conversion tools already exist but they may be dispersed, focused on a few specific formats, difficult to install, or not optimised. With Bioconvert, we plan to cover a wide spectrum of format conversions; we will re-use existing tools when possible and provide an interface to compare different conversion tools or methods via benchmarking. New implementations are provided when considered better than existing&nbsp;ones.</p>
<p>Bioconvert is developed in Python using continuous integration, a test suite and extensive Sphinx documentation. In March 2022, we had 48 formats, 98 direct conversions (125 different&nbsp;methods).</p>

<h2>How to increase diversity in open source&nbsp;communities</h2>
<p><em>Maren&nbsp;Westermann</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Today state of the art scientific research strongly depends on open source libraries. The demographic of the contributors to these libraries is predominantly white and male [1][2][3][4]. In recent years there have been a number of various recommendations and initiatives to increase the participation in open source projects of groups who are underrepresented in this domain [1][3][5][6]. While these efforts are valuable and much needed, contributor diversity remains a challenge in open source communities [2][3][7]. This talk highlights the underlying problems and explores how we can overcome&nbsp;them.</p>

<h2>Real-time estimation of an heat pump I/O state with IoT&nbsp;data.</h2>
<p><em>Davide&nbsp;Poggiali</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the present time, we are facing a continuous growing of the energy price. It is then important to optimize the use of heat pumps, both in domestic and industrial environments. Using an opportunely labeled dataset of accelerometer, speed or relative position over time coming from a cheap sensor it is possible to estimate the I/O state of any heating or cooling engine. This new real-time measure allows then to compute the energy consumption and to study the most cheap usage scheme.
In this presentation we will show a real-case implementation of some fast binary classifiers, from basic statistics to machine learning, assessing the performance of each method in terms of computational time, precision and accuracy&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Talk (long)</button></p>
<h2>Pragmatic Panel: Build and Deploy Complex Data-Driven&nbsp;WebApps</h2>
<p><em>Pierre-Olivier&nbsp;Simonard</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Panel is one of the leading choices for building dashboards in Python. In this talk, we discuss the practical aspects of complex data-driven dashboards. There are tutorials and guides available which help teach new users the basics, but this talk focuses on the challenges of building more complex, industry-ready, deployed dashboards. There are a variety of niche issues which arise when you push the limits of complexity, and we will share the solutions we have developed. We will demonstrate these solutions as we walk through the entire lifecycle from data ingestion, though exploratory analysis to deployment as a finished&nbsp;website.</p>

<h2>Learning Natural Language Processing with&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p><em>Grishma&nbsp;Jena</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the advent of voice-based assistants and chatbots in our homes, our phones and our computers, businesses, stakeholders and developers want to learn about language processing. But how exactly do these devices understand human language? How can they interpret similar intents even when different words are used? What does Natural Language Processing mean and what are the steps&nbsp;involved?</p>

<h2>The Beauty of&nbsp;Zarr</h2>
<p><em>Sanket&nbsp;Verma</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I’d be talking about Zarr, an open-source data format for storing chunked, compressed N-dimensional arrays. This talk presents a systematic approach to understanding and implementing Zarr by showing how it works, the need for using it, and a hands-on session at the end. Zarr is based on an open technical specification, making implementations across several languages possible. I’d be mainly talking about Zarr’s Python implementation and would show how it beautifully interoperates with the existing libraries in the PyData&nbsp;stack.</p>

<h2>scikit-learn and fairness, tools and&nbsp;challenges</h2>
<p><em>Adrin&nbsp;Jalali</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Fairness, accountability, and transparency in machine learning have become a major part of the <span class="caps">ML</span> discourse. Since these issues have attracted attention from the public, and certain legislation are being put in place regulating the usage of machine learning in certain domains, the industry has been catching up with the topic and a few groups have been developing toolboxes to allow practitioners incorporate fairness constraints into their pipelines and make their models more transparent and accountable. Some examples are fairlearn, <span class="caps">AIF360</span>, LiFT, fairness-indicators (<span class="caps">TF</span>),&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>This talk explores some of the tools existing in this domain and discusses work being done in scikit-learn to make it easier for practitioners to adopt these&nbsp;tools.</p>
<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Talk (long)</button></p>
<h2>Continuous and on demand&nbsp;benchmarking</h2>
<p><em>Mridul&nbsp;Seth</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We all know and love our carefully designed <span class="caps">CI</span> pipelines, which tests our code and makes sure by adding some code or fixing a bug we aren’t introducing a regression in the codebase. But we often don’t give the same treatment to benchmarking as we give to correctness. The benchmarking tests are usually one off scripts written to test a specific change. In this talk, we will discuss various strategies to test our code for performance regressions using <span class="caps">ASV</span> (airspeed velocity) for python&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Talk</button></p>
<h2>Scipp plot: modular interactive plotting from graph&nbsp;nodes</h2>
<p><em>nvaytet</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> We present the plotting framework of the <a href="https://scipp.github.io/">Scipp package</a> for multi-dimensional arrays.
Based on the Model View Controller pattern, it uses a set of nodes connected in a graph to represent a sequence of processing steps that can be applied to the data before plotting it onto the figure axes.
A common example of this could be a 2D scatter plot, accompanied by 1D histograms of the data points on the top and right hand side of the scatter axes.
The histogramming nodes, that lie below the original root data node in the graph, perform a histogram operation in each of the X and Y dimensions, and their results get sent to the top and right plotting&nbsp;axes.</p>
<p>The use of a graph of connected nodes opens up the opportunity for a very modular way of creating interactive plots.
For instance, using a library of widgets (such as ipywidgets), we can change the input to one of the nodes, which notifies all the nodes below it about the change.
This means that modifying a parameter of the scatter data with e.g. a slider, would automatically update not only the main scatter plot, but also the histograms on the&nbsp;sides.</p>
<p>Any function (smoothing, fitting, filtering …) can be used inside a node, and any number of axes (or views) can be attached to a given node. This flexibility allows users to create complicated interactive visualizations with just a few lines of&nbsp;code.</p>

<h2>Machine learning with missing&nbsp;values</h2>
<p><em>Gaël&nbsp;Varoquaux</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk will cover how to build predictive models that handle well missing values, using scikit-learn. It will give on the one side the statistical considerations, both the classic statistical missing-values theory and the recent development in machine learning, and on the other side how to efficiently code&nbsp;solutions.</p>
<p><button type="button" class="btn btn-primary">Talk</button></p>
<h2>Elevating Contributor Experience: Development of SciPy command-line interface (<span class="caps">CLI</span>)</h2>
<p><em>Sayantika&nbsp;Banik</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Open-source contributions could be daunting to start with, new contributors often find it challenging to navigate documentation and get started. I also had similar experiences, as a newcomer to the world of open source. The idea of elevating contributor experience could range in a variety of lengths and breadths,  though a tiny step forward could be very&nbsp;helpful.</p>
<p><strong>How can we achieve this?</strong>
- Identifying the bottlenecks, which aid in degraded contributing experience.
- Getting feedback from the community and contributors.
- Coming up with a feasible solution.
- Experimenting and&nbsp;improving.</p>
<p>At SciPy, we sailed through a similar journey and developed an informative and intuitive command-line interface, aiming to guide&nbsp;contributors.</p>

<h2><span class="caps">CLAIMED</span> - An open source unified platform for batch, streaming and microservices based data&nbsp;science</h2>
<p><em>Romeo&nbsp;Kienzler</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data are processed in pipelines – either an entire data set, in batches or one by one. A variety of programming languages, frameworks and libraries exists. In <span class="caps">CLAIMED</span> – the component library for <span class="caps">AI</span>, Machine Learning, <span class="caps">ETL</span> and Data Science – we provide an opinionated set of coarse grained components implemented as jupyter notebooks. Through C3, the claimed component compiler those can be (as of now) transformed into Kubeflow Pipeline Components, Airflow Operators or simple (docker) container images to be executed on Knative. An adapter implemented as side car transforms those into either streaming components (currently http(s) and Kafka) or micro services – with scale to zero support. Using the jupyter lab Elyra pipeline editor and <span class="caps">CLAIMED</span>, anybody can create data science pipelines without programming skills. But the source code is only one click away. The jupyter notebook backing the component is available for review, adjustments or improvements of the&nbsp;components.</p>

<h2>Increase citations, ease review <span class="amp">&amp;</span> collaboration – Making machine learning in research&nbsp;reproducible</h2>
<p><em>Jesper&nbsp;Dramsch</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Every scientific conference has seen a massive uptick in applications that use some type of machine learning. Whether it’s a linear regression using scikit-learn, a transformer from Hugging Face, or a custom convolutional neural network in Jax, the breadth of applications is as vast as the quality of&nbsp;contributions.</p>
<p>This tutorial aims to provide easy ways to increase the quality of scientific contributions that use machine learning methods. The reproducible aspect will make it easy for fellow researchers to use and iterate on a publication, increasing citations of published work. The use of appropriate validation techniques and increase in code quality accelerates the review process during publication and avoids possible rejection due to deficiencies in the methodology. Making models, code and possibly data available increases the visibility of work and enables easier collaboration on future&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>This work to make machine learning applications reproducible has an outsized impact compared to the limited additional work that is required using existing Python&nbsp;libraries.</p>

<h2>Parallelizing your <span class="caps">ETL</span> with Dask on&nbsp;Kubeflow</h2>
<p><em>Jacob&nbsp;Tomlinson</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Dask now has even better integration with Kubeflow, allowing folks to leverage advanced parallelism in Python for both interactive and pipeline workflows. Hardware acceleration and parallelism have long been leveraged in Machine Learning and Deep Learning tasks, but now you can get the same superpowers in your data exploration, processing, and <span class="caps">ETL</span> steps&nbsp;too.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will cover Dask’s new Kubernetes Operator, installing it on your Kubeflow cluster, and show examples of leveraging it in interactive sessions and scheduled&nbsp;workflows.</p>

<h2>Discovering Mathematical Optimization with&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p><em>Pamela Alejandra Bustamante&nbsp;Faúndez</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Mathematical optimization is the selection of the best alternative with respect to some criterion, among a set of candidate&nbsp;options.</p>
<p>There are multiple applications of mathematical optimization. For example, in investment portfolio optimization, we search for the best way to invest capital given different alternatives. In this case, an optimization problem will allow us to choose a portfolio that minimizes risk (or maximizes profit), among all possible allocations that meet the defined&nbsp;requirements.</p>
<p>In most cases, mathematical optimization is used as a tool to facilitate decision-making. Sometimes these decisions can be made automatically in&nbsp;real-time.</p>
<p>This talk will explore how to formulate and solve mathematical optimization problems with Python, using different optimization&nbsp;libraries.</p>

<h2>Emergent structures in noisy channel&nbsp;message-passing</h2>
<p><em>Iliya&nbsp;Zhechev</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this <a href="https://ichko.github.io/emergent-structures-in-robust-message-passing">blog post</a>, we will explain a mechanism for generating neural network glyphs, like the glyphs we use in human languages. Glyphs are purposeful marks, images with 2D structure used to communicate information. We will use neural networks to generate those structured images, by optimizing for&nbsp;robustness.</p>

<h2>Sliding into Causal Inference, with&nbsp;Python!</h2>
<p><em>Alon&nbsp;Nir</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> What would the world look like if Russia had won the cold war? If the Boston Tea Party never happened? And where would we all be if Guido van Rossum had decided to pursue a career in theatre? Unfortunately we don&#8217;t have the technology to slide into parallel worlds and explore alternative histories. However it turns out we <em>do</em> have the tools to simulate parallel realities and give decent answers to intriguing &#8216;what if&#8217; questions. This talk will provide a gentle introduction to these tools, professionally known as Causal&nbsp;Inference.</p>

<h2>Informative and pleasant dataviz with Raincloud&nbsp;plot</h2>
<p><em>Davide&nbsp;Poggiali</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Categorical plots offer a variety of plotting styles that allows the user to picture even large datasets showing some summary statistics of the data. In some case graphs can be misleading, either unwilling or on purpose. The reader can be confused or even get an incorrect idea of the phenomenon underlying the data.
In this talk we introduce the Raincloud plot, a multi-language plotting style aimed to create charming and informative graphical representations of a dataset. After some introduction, we will offer a simple tutorial that will cover different use cases. We will then compare the Raincloud plots with some other plot styles, showing that some data misunderstanding can be avoided with a sufficiently detailed&nbsp;plot.</p>

<h2>Data-Driven Thresholding for Extreme Event Detection in&nbsp;Geosciences</h2>
<p><em>Milton&nbsp;Gomez</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Extreme weather events are a well known source of human suffering, loss of life, and financial hardship. Amongst these, tropical cyclones are notoriously impactful, leading to significant interest in predicting the genesis, tracks, and intensity of these storms - a task which continues to present significant challenges. In particular, tropical cyclogenesis (<span class="caps">TCG</span>) can be described as “a needle in a haystack” problem, and steps must be taken to make predictions tractable. Previously, the filtering of non-genesis points by thresholding predictive variables has been described, with thresholds being selected to reduce the number of discarded <span class="caps">TCG</span> cases. In the art, this thresholding has often been carried out empirically, that while effective relies on domain knowledge. This talk instead proposes the development of a systematic, machine-learning-based approach implemented in Python using the SciPy optimization library. The method is designed to be interpretable to the point of becoming transparent machine learning. Threshold values that minimize the false-alarm rate and maintain a high recall are found, and then combined in a forward selection algorithm. As other extreme events in the geosciences are considered needle in the haystack problems, the described approach can be of use in reducing the variable space in which to study and predict the events. Finally, the transparent nature of the proposed approach can provide simple insight into the conditions in which these events&nbsp;occur.</p>

<h2>Array expressions and symbolic gradients in&nbsp;SymPy</h2>
<p><em>Francesco&nbsp;Bonazzi</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> SymPy is an open source computer algebra system (<span class="caps">CAS</span>) written in&nbsp;Python.</p>
<p>The recent addition of the array expression module provides an alternative to the matrix expression module, with generalized support to higher dimensions (matrices are constrained to 2&nbsp;dimensions).</p>
<p>Given the importance of multidimensional arrays in machine learning and mathematical optimization problems, this talk will illustrate examples of tensorial expressions in mathematics and how they can be manipulated using either module or in the index-explicit&nbsp;way.</p>
<p>Conversion tools have been provided to SymPy to allow users to switch an expression between the array form and either the matrix or index-explicit form. In particular, the conversion from array to matrix form attempts to represent contractions, diagonalizations and axis-permutations with operations commonly used in matrix algebra, such as matrix multiplication, transposition, trace, Hadamard and Kronecker&nbsp;products.</p>
<p>A gradient algorithm for array expressions has been implemented, returning a closed-form array expression equivalent to the derivative of arrays by arrays. The derivative algorithm for matrix expressions now uses this algorithm, attempting to convert the array back to matrix form if trivial dimensions can be&nbsp;dropped.</p>

<h2>Scipp: Multi-dimensional data arrays with labeled dimensions for dense and binned&nbsp;data</h2>
<p><em>Simon&nbsp;Heybrock</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inspired by Xarray, <a href="https://scipp.github.io/">Scipp</a> enriches raw NumPy-like multi-dimensional arrays of data by adding named dimensions and associated coordinates. For an even more intuitive and less error-prone user experience, Scipp furthermore adds physical units to arrays and their coordinates. Scipp data arrays additionally support a dictionary of masks, basic propagation of uncertainties, and bin-edge&nbsp;coordinates.</p>
<p>On top of the above, Scipp&#8217;s key feature is support for multi-dimensional non-destructive binning of record-based &#8220;tabular&#8221; data into arrays of bins. The use of labeled arrays with coordinates to represent the table of records allows for clear conceptual association of a record&#8217;s metadata with dimensions and coordinates of the array of bins. Based on this, Scipp can provide fast, flexible, and efficient binning, rebinning, and filtering operations, all while preserving the original individual&nbsp;records.</p>
<p>Scipp ships with data display and visualization features for Jupyter notebooks, including a powerful plotting&nbsp;interface.</p>

<h2>What is Contributor&nbsp;Experience?</h2>
<p><em>Noa&nbsp;Tamir</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In my current work as a contributor experience lead, I am supporting and growing Matplotlib’s and Pandas’ communities by organizing events, meetings, and proactive engagement with a focus on equity and inclusion of historically marginalized groups. In my talk I’ll give an introduction to this new role, the grant that supports it, and some of the work done so&nbsp;far…</p>
<p>I will share takeaways for maintainers, and contributors; from simple changes that can be implemented relatively easily, to bigger topics, which one might want to learn more about, and slowly yet proactively, facilitate changes to tweak the contributor experience for a&nbsp;project.</p>

<h2>Elephants, ibises and a more Pythonic way to work with&nbsp;databases</h2>
<p><em>Marlene&nbsp;Mhangami</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, I will be sharing about Ibis, a software package that provides a more Pythonic way of interacting with multiple database engines. In my own adventures living in Zimbabwe, I’ve always encountered ibises (the bird versions) perched on top of elephants. If you’ve never seen an elephant in real life I can confirm that they are huge, complex creatures. The image of a small bird sitting on top of a large elephant serves as a metaphor for how ibis (the package) provides a less complex, more performant way for Pythonistas to interact with multiple big data&nbsp;engines.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll use the metaphor of elephants and ibises to show how this package can make a data workflow more Pythonic. The Zen of Python lets us know that simple is better than complex. The bigger and more complex your data, the more of an argument there is to use Ibis. Raw <span class="caps">SQL</span> can be quite difficult to maintain when your queries are very complex. For Python programmers, Ibis offers a way to write <span class="caps">SQL</span> in Python that allows for unit-testing, composability, and abstraction over specific query engines (e.g.BigQuery)! You can carry out joins, filters, and other operations on your data in a familiar, Pandas-like syntax. Overall, using Ibis simplifies your workflows, makes you more productive, and keeps your code&nbsp;readable</p>

<h2>Evaluating your machine learning models: beyond the&nbsp;basics</h2>
<p><em>Gaël&nbsp;Varoquaux</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This tutorial will guide towards good evaluation of machine-learning models, choosing metrics and procedures that match the intended usage, with code examples using the latest scikit-learn&#8217;s features. We will discuss how good metrics should characterize all aspects of error, e.g. on the positive and negative class; the probability of a detection, or the probability of a true event given a detection; as they may need to catter for class imbalance. Metrics may also evaluate confidence scores, e.g. calibration. Model-evaluation procedures should gauge not only the expected generalization performance, but also its&nbsp;variations.</p>

<h2>napari: a multi-dimensional image visualization, annotation, and analysis platform in&nbsp;Python</h2>
<p><em>Kevin&nbsp;Yamauchi</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Napari is an interactive, <span class="caps">GPU</span>-accelerated, nD image viewer written in python. It displays images in a 2D or 3D canvas, then provides sliders for any additional dimensions in a dataset. It can also overlay associated data such as segmentations, points, polygons, surfaces, vectors, and tracks. Finally, napari is well-integrated with the scientific python ecosystem: NumPy arrays are the primary data structure used for visualization, and other standard arrays (such as Zarr or Dask arrays) are also supported. This makes it easy to insert interactive visualization, curation, and annotation steps into any workflow using standard SciPy libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, dask, and scikit-image. In this talk, I will introduce napari and demonstrate how napari can be used for interactive image&nbsp;analysis.</p>
