  <h2 id="enforcement-procedures">Enforcement Procedures</h2><p>This document summarizes the procedures the EuroSciPy staff uses to enforce the Code of
Conduct.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-processes">Summary of processes</h3><p>When the work group receives a report of a possible Code of Conduct violation, it will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acknowledge the receipt of the report.</li>
<li>Evaluate conflicts of interest.</li>
<li>Call a meeting of Code of Conduct responders who do not have a conflict of interest.</li>
<li>Evaluate the reported incident.</li>
<li>Propose a behavioral modification plan.</li>
<li>Propose consequences for the reported behavior.</li>
<li>Vote on behavioral modification plan and consequences for the reported person.</li>
<li>Contact online community administrators/moderators to approve the behavioral modification plan and consequences.</li>
<li>Follow up with the reported person.</li>
<li>Decide further responses.</li>
<li>Follow up with the reporter.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="acknowledge-the-report">Acknowledge the report</h3><p>Reporters should receive an emailed acknowledgment of the receipt of their report within 24 hours.</p>
<h3 id="conflict-of-interest-policy">Conflict of interest policy</h3><p>Examples of conflicts of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The reporter or reported person is your manager</li>
<li>You have a romantic or platonic relationship with either the reporter or the reported person. It's fine to participate
if they are an acquaintance.</li>
<li>The reporter or reported person is your metamour. (This is a term used in the poly community; the short definition
is <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Metamour">here</a>, and a longer description
is <a href="https://solopoly.net/2012/09/29/whats-a-metamour-on-my-terms/">here</a>).</li>
<li>The reporter or reported person is your family member</li>
<li>The reporter or reported person is your direct client</li>
<li>The reporter or reported person is someone you work closely with. This could be someone on your team or someone who
works on the same project as you.</li>
<li>The reporter or reported person is a maintainer who regularly reviews your contributions</li>
</ul>
<p>Committee members do not need to state why they have a conflict of interest, only that one exists. Other work group
members should not ask why the person has a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>Anyone who has a conflict of interest will remove themselves from the discussion of the incident, and recuse themselves
from voting on a response to the report.</p>
<h3 id="evaluating-a-report">Evaluating a report</h3><h4 id="jurisdiction">JURISDICTION</h4><ul>
<li><em>Is this a Code of Conduct violation?</em> Is this behavior on our list of inappropriate behavior? Is it borderline
inappropriate behavior? Does it violate our community norms?</li>
<li><em>Did this occur in a space that is within our Code of Conduct's scope?</em> If the incident occurred outside the
community, but a community member's mental health or physical safety may be negatively impacted if no action is taken,
the incident may be in scope. Private conversations in community spaces are also in scope.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="impact">IMPACT</h4><ul>
<li><em>Did this incident occur in a private conversation or in a public space?</em> Incidents that all community members can see
will have more negative impact.</li>
<li><em>Does this behavior negatively impact a marginalized group in our community?</em> Is the reporter a person from a
marginalized group in our community? How is the reporter being negatively impacted by the reported person's behavior?
Are members of the marginalized group likely to disengage with the community if no action was taken on this report?</li>
<li><em>Does this incident involve a community leader?</em> Community members often look up to community leaders to set the
standard of acceptable behavior.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="risk">RISK</h4><ul>
<li><em>Does this incident include sexual harassment?</em></li>
<li><em>Does this pose a safety risk?</em> Does the behavior put a person's physical safety at risk? Will this incident severely
negatively impact someone's mental health?</li>
<li><em>Is there a risk of this behavior being repeated?</em> Does the reported person understand why their behavior was
inappropriate? Is there an established pattern of behavior from past reports?</li>
</ul>
<p>Reports which involve higher risk or higher impact may face more severe consequences than reports which involve lower
risk or lower impact.</p>
<h3 id="propose-a-behavioral-modification-plan">Propose a behavioral modification plan</h3><p>The event staff will determine a concrete behavioral modification plan that ensures the inappropriate behavior is not
repeated. The event staff will also discuss what actions may need to be taken if the reported person does not agree to
the behavioral modification plan.</p>
<p>What follows are examples of possible behavioral modification plans for incidents that occur in online spaces under the
scope of this Code of Conduct. This behavioral modification list is not inclusive, and the event staff reserves the
right to take any action it deems necessary.</p>
<ul>
<li>Requiring that the reported person not use specific language</li>
<li>Requiring that the reported person not join in on specific types of discussions</li>
<li>Requiring that the reported person not send private messages to a community member</li>
<li>Requiring that the reported person not join specific communication channels</li>
<li>Removing the reported person from administrator or moderator rights to community infrastructure</li>
<li>Removing a volunteer from their duties and responsibilities</li>
<li>Removing a person from leadership of relevant organizations</li>
<li>Removing a person from membership of relevant organizations</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="propose-consequences">Propose consequences</h3><p>What follows are examples of possible consequences of an incident report. This list of consequences is not inclusive,
and the event staff reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary.</p>
<p>Possible private responses to an incident include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nothing, if the behavior was determined to not be a Code of Conduct violation</li>
<li>A verbal or emailed warning</li>
<li>A final warning</li>
<li>Temporarily removing the reported person from the online community</li>
<li>Permanently removing the reported person from the online community</li>
<li>Publishing an account of the incident</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="follow-up-with-the-reported-person">Follow up with the reported person</h3><p>The event staff will work with online community administrators/moderators to draft a response to the reported person.
The email should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li>A description of the person's behavior in neutral language</li>
<li>The negative impact of that behavior</li>
<li>A concrete behavioral modification plan</li>
<li>Any consequences of their behavior</li>
</ul>
<p>The work group should not state who reported this incident. They should attempt to anonymize any identifying information
from the report. The reported person should be discouraged from contacting the reporter to discuss the report. If they
wish to apologize to the reporter, the work group can accept the apology on behalf of the reporter.</p>
<p>Decide further responses</p>
<p>If the reported person provides additional context, the event staff may need to re-evaluate the behavioral modification
plan and consequences.</p>
<h3 id="follow-up-with-the-reporter">Follow up with the reporter</h3><p>A person who makes a report should receive a follow-up email stating what action was taken in response to the report. If
the work group decided no response was necessary, they should provide an email explaining why it was not a Code of
Conduct violation. Reports that are not made in good faith (such as "reverse sexism" or "reverse racism") may receive no
response.</p>
<p>The follow-up email should be sent no later than one week after the receipt of the report. If deliberation or follow up
with the reported person takes longer than one week, the work group should send a status email to the reporter.</p>
