<h2 id="lpython-novel-fast-retargetable-python-compiler">LPython: Novel, Fast, Retargetable Python&nbsp;Compiler</h2>
<p><em>Naman Gera</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Python is one of the most used languages today, known for its simplicity and versatile ecosystem. For performance applications such as High Performance Computing (<span class="caps">HPC</span>) or any other kind of numerical computing the standard CPython implementation is often not fast enough. To address these issues, enter the fascinating world of LPython, a Python compiler designed to give you the best possible performance for numerical, array-oriented code, and can also generate code using multiple backends like <span class="caps">LLVM</span>, C, C++, <span class="caps">WASM</span>.</p>

<h2 id="simulated-data-is-all-you-need-bayesian-parameter-inference-for-scientific-simulators-with-sbi">Simulated data is all you need: Bayesian parameter inference for scientific simulators with <span class="caps">SBI</span></h2>
<p><em>Jan Boelts (Teusen)</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Scientific&nbsp;Applications</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Simulators play a crucial role in scientific research, but accurately determining their parameters to reproduce observed data remains a significant challenge. Classical parameter inference methods often struggle due to the stochastic or black-box nature of these simulators. Simulation-based inference (<span class="caps">SBI</span>) offers a solution by enabling Bayesian parameter inference for simulation-based models: It only requires simulated data as input and returns a posterior distribution over suitable model parameters, including uncertainty estimates and parameter interactions. In this talk, we introduce <span class="caps">SBI</span> and present <a href="https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi/"><code>sbi</code></a>, an open source library that serves as a central resource for <span class="caps">SBI</span> practitioners and researchers, offering state-of-the-art <span class="caps">SBI</span> algorithms, comprehensive documentation and&nbsp;tutorials.</p>

<p><em>Tim Head, Sebastian Berg</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Python code that works with Numpy, Cupy and PyTorch arrays? Use a <span class="caps">GPU</span> when possible, but fallback to using a <span class="caps">CPU</span> if there is none? We will show you how you can write Python code that can do all of the above. The not so secret ingredient to do this is the Array <span class="caps">API</span>. In this workshop you will learn what the Array <span class="caps">API</span> is and how to use it to write programs that can take any compatible array as&nbsp;input.</p>

<h2 id="from-data-analysis-in-jupyter-notebooks-to-production-applications-ai-infrastructure-at-reasonable-scale">From data analysis in Jupyter Notebooks to production applications: <span class="caps">AI</span> infrastructure at reasonable&nbsp;scale</h2>
<p><em>Frank Sauerburger</em>,  <em>Talk (15 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The availability of <span class="caps">AI</span> models and packages in the Python ecosystem has revolutionized many applications across domains. This talk discusses infrastructural decisions and best practices that bridge the gap between interactive data analyses in notebooks and production applications at a reasonable scale, suitable for both commercial and scientific contexts. In particular, the talk introduces the on-premises, Python-based <span class="caps">AI</span> architecture employed at <span class="caps">MDPI</span>, one of the largest open-access publishers. The presentation emphasizes the impact of the design on reproducibility, decoupling of different resources, and ease of use during the development and exploration&nbsp;phases.</p>

<h2 id="multi-dimensional-arrays-with-scipp">Multi-dimensional arrays with&nbsp;Scipp</h2>
<p><em>Mridul Seth</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Inspired by xarray, Scipp enriches raw NumPy-like multi-dimensional data arrays by adding named dimensions and associated coordinates. For an even more intuitive and less error-prone user experience, Scipp adds physical units to arrays and their coordinates. Through this tutorial, participants will learn about the basics of modelling their data with the Scipp library and using in built tools in Scipp for scientific data&nbsp;analysis.</p>
<p>One of Scipp&#8217;s key features is the possibility of using multi-dimensional non-destructive binning to sort record-based &#8220;tabular&#8221;/&#8221;event&#8221; data into arrays of bins. This provides fast and flexible binning, rebinning, and filtering operations, all while preserving the original individual&nbsp;records.</p>
<p>Scipp ships with data display and visualization features for Jupyter notebooks, including a powerful plotting interface. Named Plopp, this tool uses a graph of connected nodes to provide interactivity between multiple plots and widgets, requiring only a few lines of code from the&nbsp;user.</p>
<p>Scipp is available via pip and conda and runs on Linux, Mac and&nbsp;Windows.</p>

<h2 id="decorators-a-deep-dive">Decorators - A Deep&nbsp;Dive</h2>
<p><em>Mike Müller</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Scientific&nbsp;Applications</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Python offers decorator to implement re-usable code for cross-cutting task.
The support the separation of cross-cutting concerns such as logging, caching,
or checking of permissions.
This can improve code modularity and&nbsp;maintainability.</p>
<p>This tutorial is an in-depth introduction to decorators.
It covers the usage of decorators and how to implement simple and more advanced
decorators.
Use cases demonstrate how to work with decorators.
In addition to showing how functions can use closures to create decorators,
the tutorial introduces callable class instance as alternative.
Class decorators can solve problems that use be to be tasks for metaclasses.
The tutorial provides uses cases for class&nbsp;decorators.</p>
<p>While the focus is on best practices and practical applications, the tutorial
also provides deeper insight into how Python works behind the scene.
After the tutorial participants will feel comfortable with functions that take
functions and return new&nbsp;functions.</p>

<h2 id="the-joys-and-pains-of-reproducing-research-an-experiment-in-bioimaging-data-analysis">The joys and pains of reproducing research: An experiment in bioimaging data&nbsp;analysis</h2>
<p><em>Marianne Corvellec</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Data Science and&nbsp;Visualisation</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The conversation about reproducibility is usually focused on how to make research workflows (more) reproducible. Here, we consider it from the opposite perspective, and ask: How feasible is it, in practice, to reproduce research which is meant to be reproducible? Is it even done or attempted? We provide a detailed account of such an attempt, trying to reproduce some segmentation results for 3D microscopy images of a developing mouse embryo. The original research is a monumental work of bioimaging and analysis at the single-cell level, published in <em>Cell</em> in 2018, alongside with all the necessary research artifacts. Did we succeed in this attempt? As we share the joys and pains of this journey, many questions arise: How do reviewers assess the reproducibility claims exactly? Incentivizing reproducible research is still an open problem, since it is so much more costly (in time) to produce. And how can we incentivize those who test reproducibility? Not only is it costly to set up computational environments and execute data-intensive scientific workflows, but it may not appear as rewarding at first thought. In addition, there is a human factor: It is thorny to show authors that their publication does not hold up to their reproducibility&nbsp;claims.</p>

<h2 id="building-robust-workflows-with-strong-provenance">Building robust workflows with strong&nbsp;provenance</h2>
<p><em>Alexander Goscinski, Julian Geiger, Ali Khosravi</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Scientific&nbsp;Applications</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In computational science, different software packages are often glued together as scripts to perform numerical experiments. With increasing complexity, these scripts become unmaintainable, prone to crashes, hard to scale up and to collaborate on. AiiDA solves these problems via a powerful workflow engine and by keeping provenance for the entire workflow. In this tutorial, we learn how to create dynamic workflows combining together different executables that automatically can restart from failed runs and reuse results from completed calculations via&nbsp;caching.</p>

<h2 id="the-array-api-standard-in-scipy">The Array <span class="caps">API</span> Standard in&nbsp;SciPy</h2>
<p><em>Lucas Colley</em>,  <em>Talk (15 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The array <span class="caps">API</span> standard is unifying the ecosystem of Python array computing, facilitating greater interoperability between array libraries, including NumPy, CuPy, PyTorch, <span class="caps">JAX</span>, and Dask. Find out how we are using it in SciPy to bring support for hardware-accelerated (e.g. <span class="caps">GPU</span>) and distributed arrays to our users, and how you can do the same in your&nbsp;library.</p>

<p><em>Janos Gabler</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Community, Education, and&nbsp;Outreach</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many scientific Python packages are &#8220;stringly typed,&#8221; i.e., using strings to select algorithms or methods and dictionaries for configuration. While easy for beginners and convenient for authors, these libraries miss out on static typing benefits like error detection before runtime and autocomplete. This talk shares insights from redesigning the optimagic library from the ground up with static typing in mind. Without compromising on simplicity, we achieve better static analysis, autocomplete, and fewer runtime errors. The insights are not specific to numerical optimization and apply to a wide range of scientific Python&nbsp;packages.</p>

<p><em>Loïc Estève</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> CPython 3.13 will be released in October 2024 and has been in beta since May 2024. One of its most awaited features is the possibility to remove the <span class="caps">GIL</span> (Global Interpreter Lock) through a compile-time&nbsp;flag.</p>
<p>In this talk we will explain the relevance of free-threaded CPython for the Scientific Python ecosystem, what already works, some of the caveats, and how to try it out on your favourite use&nbsp;case. </p>
<p>In particular we will discuss:
- the historic effort in the scikit-learn project to add Continuous Integration for the <code>nogil</code> fork of CPython 3.9, and the kind of issues that were surfaced
- the ongoing effort in the Scientific Python ecosystem (Numpy, Scipy, scikit-learn, etc &#8230;) to test free-threaded CPython 3.13 and fix issues along the way
- how a typical scikit-learn grid-search use case can benefit from free-threaded CPython
- how to try out free-threaded CPython on your favourite use case
- possible future&nbsp;developments</p>

<h2 id="the-parallel-universe-in-python-a-time-travel-to-python-313-and-beyond">The Parallel Universe in Python - A Time Travel to Python 3.13 and&nbsp;beyond</h2>
<p><em>Mike Müller</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Parallel computing is essential for many performance-critical applications. Python provides many solutions for this problem. New versions of Python will support sub-interpreters and a, currently experimental, free-threading version without the Global Interpreter Lock (<span class="caps">GIL</span>).</p>
<p>This talk starts with a short overview over this topic, clarifying terms such parallel, concurrent, and distribute computing as well as <span class="caps">CPU</span>-bound, memory-bound, and <span class="caps">IO</span>-bound problems. The presentation explains how Python and its standard library support parallel programming tasks. In addition, many Python libraries provide very useful approaches and tools for parallel computing. An overview of important libraries provides guidance which library can be used for what type of parallel&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>How do Python&#8217;s new features such as sub-interpreters and free-threading without the Global Interpreter Lock (<span class="caps">GIL</span>) impact parallel Programming in Python? This talk address this question by providing examples where these features might help to make programs simpler and/or&nbsp;faster.</p>

<h2 id="skrub-prepping-tables-for-machine-learning">Skrub: prepping tables for machine&nbsp;learning</h2>
<p><em>Guillaume Lemaitre</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> When it comes to designing machine learning predictive models, it is reported that data scientists spend over 80% of their time preparing the data to input to the machine learning&nbsp;algorithm.</p>
<p>Currently, no automated solution exists to address this problem. However, the <code>skrub</code> Python library is here to alleviate some of the daily tasks of data scientists and offer an integration with the <code>scikit-learn</code> machine learning&nbsp;library.</p>
<p>In this talk, we provide an overview of the features available in <code>skrub</code>.</p>
<p>First, we focus on the preprocessing stage closest to the data sources. While predictive models usually expect a single design matrix and a target vector (or matrix), in practice, it is common that data are available from different data tables. It is also possible that the data to be merged are slightly different, making it difficult to join them. We will present the <code>skrub</code> joiners that handle such use cases and are fully compatible with <code>scikit-learn</code> and its&nbsp;pipeline.</p>
<p>Then, another issue widely tackled by data scientists is dealing with heterogeneous data types (e.g., dates, categorical, numerical). We will present the <code>TableVectorizer</code>, a preprocessor that automatically handles different types of encoding and transformation, reducing the amount of boilerplate code to write when designing predictive models with <code>scikit-learn</code>. Like the joiner, this transformer is fully compatible with <code>scikit-learn</code>.</p>

<h2 id="optimagic-can-we-unify-pythons-numerical-optimization-ecosystem">Optimagic: Can we unify Python&#8217;s numerical optimization&nbsp;ecosystem?</h2>
<p><em>Janos Gabler</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Community, Education, and&nbsp;Outreach</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Python has many high quality optimization algorithms but they are scattered across many different packages. Switching between packages is cumbersome and time consuming. Other languages are ahead of Python in this respect. For example, <code>Optimization.jl</code> provides a unified interface to more than 100 optimization algorithms and is widely accepted as a standard interface for optimization in&nbsp;Julia. </p>
<p>In this talk, we take stock of the existing optimization ecosystem in Python and analyze pain points and reasons why no single package has emerged as a standard so far. We use these findings to derive desirable features a Python optimization package would need to unify the&nbsp;ecosystem. </p>
<p>We then present optimagic, a NumFocus affiliated Project with the goal of unifying the Python optimization ecosystem. Optimagic provides a common interface to optimization algorithms from scipy, NlOpt, pygmo, and many other libraries. The minimize function feels familiar to users of scipy.optimize who are looking for a more extensive set of 
supported optimizers. Advanced users can use optional arguments to configure every aspect of the optimization, create a persistent log file, turn local optimizers global with a multistart framework, and&nbsp;more. </p>
<p>Finally, we discuss an ambitious roadmap for improvements, new features, and planned community activities for&nbsp;optimagic.</p>

<p><em>Claudio G. Giancaterino</em>,  <em>Talk (15 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Data Science and&nbsp;Visualisation</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In the ever-evolving landscape of data science, accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making processes. Conformal Prediction (<span class="caps">CP</span>) stands out as a powerful framework for addressing this challenge by providing reliable uncertainty estimates alongside predictions. In this talk, I&#8217;ll delve into the world of Conformal Prediction, with a focus on the <span class="caps">MAPIE</span> Python library, offering a comprehensive understanding of its advantages and practical&nbsp;applications.</p>

<p><em>Katharine Jarmul</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk, we&#8217;ll review the landscape of open-source federated learning libraries with a lens on actual real world data problems, use cases and actors who could benefit from federated learning. We&#8217;ll then analyze gaps, weaknesses and explore new ways we could formulate federated learning problems (and their associated libraries!) to build more useful software and use decentralized machine learning in real world use&nbsp;cases.</p>

<h2 id="paths-in-parallel-creating-custom-networkx-backends">Paths in Parallel: Creating Custom NetworkX&nbsp;Backends</h2>
<p><em>Erik Welch, Aditi Juneja</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Community, Education, and&nbsp;Outreach</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Hi! Have you ever wished your Python libraries could run faster algorithms? Or wanted to fundamentally improve a python library by re-writing everything in a faster language like C or&nbsp;Rust? </p>
<p>NetworkX is a popular, pure Python library used for graph(aka network) analysis. But, when the graph size increases (like a network of everyone in the world) then networkx algorithms could take days to solve a simple graph analysis problem. So, to address these performance issues, recently, a backend dispatch mechanism was developed. This mechanism leverages Python&#8217;s package discovery mechanism using <a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points"><code>entry_points</code></a>&nbsp;specification.</p>
<p>In this talk, we will unveil NetworkX&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> Dispatching architecture that lets us redirect the plain old NetworkX’s function call to an alternative implementation present in a backend package, just by specifying a <code>backend</code> kwarg like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="err">&gt;&gt;&gt; nx.betweenness_centrality(Graph, backend=“parallel”)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We will also go over all the implementation details and challenges of this dispatching mechanism, and then we’ll use the example of the nx-parallel as a guide to building our own custom NetworkX backend. And then using the NetworkX&#8217;s testing suite to test this backend of ours. Ending with a quick dive into the details of the nx-parallel backend and a quick walk through of other backends and future ToDos. And then finally conclude with an interactive&nbsp;Q&amp;A.</p>

<h2 id="enhancing-bayesian-optimization-with-ensemble-models-for-categorical-domains">Enhancing Bayesian Optimization with Ensemble Models for Categorical&nbsp;Domains</h2>
<p><em>Ilya Komarov</em>,  <em>Talk (15 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Data Science and&nbsp;Visualisation</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Bayesian optimization is a powerful technique for optimizing black-box, costly-to-evaluate functions, widely applicable across diverse fields. However, Gaussian process (<span class="caps">GP</span>) models commonly used in Bayesian optimization struggle with functions defined on categorical or mixed domains, limiting optimization in scenarios with numerous categorical inputs. In this talk, we present a solution by leveraging ensemble models for probabilistic modelling, providing a robust approach to optimize functions with categorical inputs. We showcase the effectiveness of our method through a Bayesian optimization setup implemented with the BoTorch library, utilizing probabilistic models from the XGBoostLSS framework. By integrating these tools, we achieve efficient optimization on domains with categorical variables, unlocking new possibilities for optimization in practical&nbsp;applications.</p>

<h2 id="regularizing-python-using-structured-control-flow">Regularizing Python using Structured Control&nbsp;Flow</h2>
<p><em>Valentin Haenel</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>High Performance&nbsp;Computing</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we will present applied research and working code to regularize
Python programs using a Structured Control Flow Graph (<span class="caps">SCFG</span>). This is a novel
approach to rewriting programs at the source level such that the resulting
(regularized) program is potentially more amenable to compiler optimizations,
for example when using Numba[1] to compile Python.  The <span class="caps">SCFG</span> representation of
a program is simpler to analyze and thus significantly easier to optimize
because the higher order semantic information regarding the program structure
is explicitly included. This can be of great benefit to many scientific
applications such as High Performance Computing (<span class="caps">HPC</span>), a discipline that relies
heavily on compiler optimizations to turn user source code into highly
performant executables. Additionally the <span class="caps">SCFG</span> format is a first step to
representing Python programs as Regionalized Value State Dependence Graphs
(RVSDGs). This is another recently proposed program representation which is
expected to unlock even more advanced compiler optimizations at the
Intermediary Representation (<span class="caps">IR</span>) level. The talk will cover an introduction to
the theory of SCFGs and <span class="caps">RVSDG</span> and demonstrate how programs are transformed. We
will start with simple Python programs containing control-flow constructs and
then show both the <span class="caps">SCFG</span> representation and the resulting regularized result to
illustrate the&nbsp;transformations.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-numpy">Introduction to&nbsp;NumPy</h2>
<p><em>Sarah Diot-Girard</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Data Science and&nbsp;Visualisation</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Are you starting to use Python for scientific computing? Join this tutorial to know more about NumPy, the building block for nearly all libraries in the scientific ecosystem.
You will learn how to manipulate NumPy arrays, understand how they store data and discover how to get optimal performances. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to start working with NumPy and know the main pitfalls to&nbsp;avoid.</p>

<h2 id="probabilistic-classification-and-cost-sensitive-learning-with-scikit-learn">Probabilistic classification and cost-sensitive learning with&nbsp;scikit-learn</h2>
<p><em>Guillaume Lemaitre, Olivier Grisel</em>,  <em>Tutorial</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Data scientists are repeatedly told that it is absolutely critical to align their model training methodology with a specific business objective. While being a rather good advice, it usually falls short on details on how to achieve this in&nbsp;practice.</p>
<p>This hands-on tutorial aims to introduce helpful theoretical concepts and concrete software tools to help them bridge this gap. This method will be illustrated on a worked practical use case: optimizing the operations of a fraud detection system for a payment processing&nbsp;platform.</p>
<p>More specifically, we will introduce the concepts of calibrated probabilistic classifiers, how to evaluate them and fix common causes of mis-calibration. In a second part, we will explore how to turn probabilistic classifiers into optimal business decision&nbsp;makers.</p>

<h2 id="forecasting-foundation-models-evaluation-and-integration-with-sktime-challenges-and-outcomes">forecasting foundation models: evaluation and integration with sktime – challenges and&nbsp;outcomes</h2>
<p><em>Franz Kiraly</em>,  <em>Talk (25 mins + Q&amp;A)</em>, <em>Machine and Deep&nbsp;Learning</em></p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Foundation models are here for forecasting! This will conclusively solve all forecasting problems with a one-model-fits-all approach! Or … maybe&nbsp;not?</p>
<p>Fact is, an increasingly growing number of foundation models for time series and forecasting hitting the&nbsp;market.</p>
<p>To innocent end users, this situation raises various challenges and questions. How do I integrate the models as candidates into existing forecasting workflows? Are the models performant? How do they compare to more classical choices? Which one to pick? How to know whether to&nbsp;“upgrade”?</p>
<p>At sktime, we have tried so you don’t have to! Although you will probably be forced to anyway, but even then, it’s worth sharing&nbsp;experiences.</p>
<p>Our key challenges and findings are presented in this talk – for instance, the unexpected fragmentation of the ecosystem, difficulties in evaluating the models fairly, and&nbsp;more.</p>
<p>(sktime is an openly governed community with neutral point of view. You may be surprised to hear that this talk will not try to sell you a foundation&nbsp;model)</p>
