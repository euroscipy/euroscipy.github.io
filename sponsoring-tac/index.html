  <h2 id="sponsoring-terms-conditions">Sponsoring Terms &amp; Conditions</h2><ol>
<li><p>Application and Agreement</p>
<p>The Event Organizer may at its absolute discretion accept or refuse the Sponsor’s application for sponsorship made by submission of a signed Sponsorship Agreement. The Sponsor acknowledges and agrees that the Sponsorship Agreement is a binding contract once it is signed by both the Sponsor as well as the Event Organizer. In the event of conflict between the various documents forming this agreement between the parties the following order of priority shall apply:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The Sponsorship agreement</p>
<p>followed by</p>
</li>
<li>These terms and conditions</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Sponsorship Fees and Payment Terms</p>
<p>The Sponsor agrees to pay the Sponsorship Fees in accordance with the amounts and payment terms set out in the Sponsorship Agreement.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed by the parties and stated in the Sponsorship Agreement, Sponsorship Fees shall be paid by the Sponsor within 30 days of the invoice date for such Fees. If a shorter payment period for payment of Fees (or part of them) is agreed by the Sponsor and recorded in the Sponsorship Agreement, such shorter period shall apply. In all cases Fees shall in any event be paid at least 90 days before the commencement of the Event. Time shall be of the essence regarding payment of Fees.</p>
<p>In the event the Sponsor fails to meet any payment obligations, (whether as to the amounts or date of payment), then the Event Organizer shall be entitled in its sole discretion to deem that the Sponsor has cancelled its sponsorship for the event and to exercise its rights pursuant to clause 3 (Cancellation and Resale of Sponsorship item).</p>
<p>Instructions for payment will be indicated on all invoices which will be issued to the Sponsor by the Event Organizer. Bank transfer payments: All bank charges payable on transfers have to be borne by the Sponsor.</p>
<p>Sponsors whose Sponsorship Fee remains unpaid 30 days before the commencement of the Event will be denied access to the Event/ Venue.</p>
<p>If any amounts payable under this Agreement are not paid to the Event Organizer by their due date for payment (whether Fees, Cancellation Charges or otherwise), then the Event Organizer shall be entitled to charge interest on such sum from the due date for payment at the rate of 12% per annum on all late payments post due date as per the invoice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cancellation by Sponsor</p>
<p>If the Sponsor cancels the Sponsorship 6 months prior to the Event, a Cancellation Charge of 50% of the Sponsorship Fee will apply.</p>
<p>If a Sponsor cancels the Sponsorship within 3 months of the Event, the Sponsor agrees to pay 100% of the contracted Sponsorship Fee as Cancellation Charge.</p>
<p>If a Sponsor cancels with an outstanding balance due, the Sponsor remains responsible for the entire balance due, plus reasonable legal fees to collect.</p>
<p>Cancellations must be received in writing by the Event Organizer.</p>
<p>Upon receipt of Sponsorship cancellation notice, the Event Organizer shall have the absolute discretion to resell the sponsorship item(s) forfeited.</p>
<p>The Sponsor hereby acknowledges that the Cancellation Charge represents a reasonable pre- estimate of the likely losses and costs that would be incurred by the Event Organizer as a result of the Sponsor’s cancellation and that they do not represent a penalty. For the avoidance of doubt, the Event Organizer is not required to mitigate its losses and/or costs in such circumstances and the Cancellation Charge shall remain payable even where the Event Organizer is able to resell the sponsorship item.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Postponement and Cancellation by the Event Organizer</p>
<p>The Event Organizer shall be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement in the event that the holding of the Event by the Event Organizer, the performance by the Event Organizer of any of its material obligations under this Agreement and/or the attendance at the Event by the Sponsors and/or any other Sponsor and/or any visitors is impossible, illegal or substantially or materially interfered with, due to any cause or causes beyond the reasonable control of the Event Organizer or the providers of the Venue including, without limitation, any of the following: act of God, governmental act, fire, flood, blockade, strike, lock-out, sit-in, adverse weather, disease, risk to public health, accident to or breakdown of plant or machinery, shortage of any material, labour, transport, electricity or other supply, regulatory intervention, general advice or recommendation of any government (including any government agency or department), regulatory authority or international agency against travel, events and/or public gatherings, or the Venue becomes unavailable and/or unfit for occupancy and/or use (“force majeure”).</p>
<p>In the event of force majeure, the Event Organizer may cancel, amend the date of the Event or change the Venue or otherwise alter the Event. Should the Event be cancelled, curtailed or adversely affected by any cause not within the reasonable control of the Event Organizer including but not limited to any of the force majeure events as identified in the preceding paragraph, the Event Organizer shall be under no obligation to refund all or part of the sums paid by the Sponsor in respect of his participation in the Event. The Event Organizer shall be under no liability to the Sponsor or any other person in respect of any actions, proceedings, claims, demands, losses (including consequential losses), costs or expenses whatsoever which may be brought against or suffered or incurred by the Sponsor as the result thereof.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use of Branding</p>
<p>Subject to the Sponsor complying with the provisions of this Agreement, the Event Organizer hereby grants the Sponsor a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable, worldwide license for the period of time between the date of the Agreement and the end of the Event, to use the Event Organizer Branding solely and strictly for the purpose of reasonably promoting, marketing and advertising its participation in the Event.</p>
<p>Subject to the Event Organizer complying with the provisions of this Agreement, the Sponsor hereby grants the Event Organizer a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free, revocable, worldwide license, to use the Sponsor Branding solely and strictly for the purpose of promoting, marketing and advertising the Event and the Sponsor’s involvement in the Event.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h3><p>Information supplied to the Event Organizer may be used for publication (where the Sponsor provides details for inclusion in the Event directory or catalogue and website) as well as to provide the Sponsor with services and also information about the Event Organizer’s products or services in the form of direct marketing activity by phone, fax or post.</p>
<h3 id="sustainability/sponsors">Sustainability / Sponsors</h3><p>One of the ways we are supporting this initiative is by not offering the goodie bags full of flyers and giveaways like in past years. Therefore, we encourage sponsors to offer digital goodies and we kindly ask you to refrain from bringing small, disposable giveaway items for your booth.</p>
<p>Throughout the entire conference we will be using as little disposable plastic as possible and ask our sponsors to do the same. In lieu of one-time use plastic items, we ask that if you would like to engage attendees with giveaways, that you offer a limited quantity of higher quality, reusable items, or experiences. These can be selected at your discretion, and include items such as online gift-cards, experiences, or workshops. For visibility we are happy to share about these giveaways in plenary sessions. Feel free to get in touch with us to discuss your ideas before the conference.</p>
<h3 id="code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</h3><p>This conference is under <a href="../code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
