# Keynotes

We are pleased to announce the following keynotes at EuroSciPy this year.
We believed that they will be of interest to the EuroSciPy community.

### JAX and Flax: Function Transformations and Neural Networks

*Andreas Steiner - Google*

**Abstract:**

Modern accelerators (graphics processing units and tensor processing units)
allow for high performance computing at massive scale. JAX traces computation
in Python programs through the familiar numpy API, and uses XLA to compile
programs that run efficiently on these accelerators. A set of composable
function transformations allows for expressing versatile scientific computing
with an elegant syntax.

Flax provides abstractions on top of JAX that make it easy to handle weights
and other states that is required for solving problems using neural networks.

This talk first presents the basic JAX API that allows for computing gradients,
compiling functions, or vectorizing computation. It then proceeds to cover
other parts of the JAX ecosystem commonly used for neural network programming,
such as basic building blocks and optimizers.

### Keynote 2

To be announced soon.
