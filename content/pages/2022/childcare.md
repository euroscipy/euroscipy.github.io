# On-Site Child Care

We provide an on-site child care for free. This service is offered through the 
child-care services of the University of Basel, general information is available [here](https://www.unibas.ch/en/Studies/Advice/Social-Services-Healthcare/Childcare.html)
. 

Children of preschool age and babies older than two months can be accommodated.

### Registration

In order to organize this service, we need to get an accurate estimate of the
number of children by **August 14**. We therefore require you to get a free
ticket for this service. It is available at the bottom of the registration
page.

Be aware that ticket booking allows us to plan the number of slots to be
reserved. In case of a no-show or a cancellation after August 14, we will charge 
you with the full cost of the booked service.

### On-site organization

Parents can drop off and fetch their kids between 8.00 am and 5:30 pm.
Please note that, you will be asked to fill in a declaration form on the first 
day when you drop off your child at the child-care services. Please consider extra 
time for that.

**Note:** Parents of children younger than one year old should leave a telephone number at 
the childcare services and must be reachable by phone at all times.
