# Sprint

### Project sprint

A one-day sprint is organized on September 2. Open source sprints are session
where maintainers and contributors (including first time contributors) meet,
and work together in improving the open source projects. This can include bug
fixes, new features, improvements to the documentation and others.

The definitive schedule is not yet known and more sprints will be added when
they are proposed. If you want to propose a sprint, please send us a message to
<a href="mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org">maintainers@euroscipy.org</a> .

Currently, the following projects already opt-in for the day:

- Bokeh
- NetworkX
- scikit-learn

<br>

### Hackathon

The same day than other project sprints, folks from ðŸ¤— HuggingFace ðŸ¤— organize
an **hybrid hackathon** to build demo using Gradio. The hackathon takes place
in-person at the sprint location and online.
