## Financial Aid Program

Would you really love to join EuroSciPy but can't afford it? We might be able to help you!

Thanks to the support of [NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org/),
the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/),
and the [EuroPython Society](https://www.europython-society.org/),
we are offering a financial aid program to support people who may need it in order to join the conference.

We offer two types of financial aid grants:

- **Free ticket**: The ticket includes access to 2 days of tutorials + 2 days of talks + 1 day of sprints
- **Travel and accommodation costs**: We will partially cover the travel costs (hotel/transportation)

#### Grant Eligibility

Our program is open to all people with lack of budget. We can give limited numbers of subsidies, that's why we will focus on the next criteria for evaluation:

- **Diversity**: We are looking for the most diverse EuroSciPy conference.
- **Contributors**: Speakers/trainers of EuroSciPy, active people from small Python
communities, and contributors to community projects.
- **Economic factors**: Students, unemployed, or people with difficult economic situations.

#### How to apply

Please fill in the [form](https://forms.gle/RRcttd2buEd9Pznc9) before July 7th.

##### Refunds

- **Free ticket**: we will send you an individual coupon for registration. In case you
have already bought the ticket, we will refund you on the same account that you
used for purchasing the ticket.
- **Accommodation and Travel grant**: all grants involving reimbursements will be
reimbursed by bank transfer after the conference. Please, upload your receipts
(hotel invoice, plane/bus/train tickets) via the Google Form we’ll send you
after the grant acceptance notice.

**IMPORTANT:** We will do bank transfers only via SEPA transfer. Please, check
it with your bank, some information you can find
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area).

##### Guideline

- The financial aid grants will only be made available to registered attendees
actually attending the conference
- If you find that you cannot attend the conference for some reason, please send
us an email to [grants@euroscipy.org](mailto: grants@euroscipy.org), so we can
reallocate the grant
- If the applicant does not accept the grant before the deadline, the grant will
be considered rejected by the applicant
- Please submit receipts on time, not approved receipts will not be reimbursed
- Receipts should contain: your name, amount of expenses (price for the tickets or
hotels) and itinerary
- Reimbursements before the conference, or via other means such as cash
are not possible.
