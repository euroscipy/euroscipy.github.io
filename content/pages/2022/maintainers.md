## Maintainers
EuroSciPy aims to be the meeting point of maintainers of scientific open source
projects, with other contributors and their users.

### Maintainers Track

The maintainers track are informal sessions intended for discussions among
contributors.

Please [email](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) us if you have a proposal for
a maintainers session.

All the sessions will take place in the <TBA> room.

### Schedule

#### Scientific Python / SPECs
**Chair: Jarrod Millman**
**Time: <TBA>**

The [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project aims to better
coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community. This session focuses on our
efforts to better coordinate project development, and to improve shared
infrastructure. In this session together we will discuss project goals and
recent technical work.

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way towards a
unified, expanded scientific Python community. It focuses its efforts along two
primary axes: _(i)_ to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and _(ii)_ to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical
infrastructure and tools. In this session we mostly focus on the second aspect.

The project has already launched a process whereby projects can, voluntarily,
adopt reference guidelines; these are known as
[SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/) or Scientific Python Ecosystem
Coordination documents. SPECs are similar to projects specific guidelines like
PEPs, NEPs, SLEPs, and SKIPs, to name a few. The distinction being that SPECs
have a broader scope, targeted at all (or most) projects from the scientific
Python ecosystem.

The project also provides and maintains tools to help maintainers. This
includes a theme for the project websites (currently used on, e.g., numpy.org
and scipy.org), a self-hosted privacy-friendly web analytics platform, a
community discussions forum, a technical blog, and project development
statistics.

We present all these tools, discuss various upcoming SPECs, and highlight the
project's future potential.

The Scientific Python project is already supported by eight core projects:
IPython, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and
SciPy. The organization has spent the last several months working on the
infrastructure, and is now ready to engage more widely to help grow and support
the community.

#### Education - Materials, methods, tools
**Chair: Mx Chiin-Rui Tan (She/Her, They/Them)**
**Time: <TBA>**

This session focuses on issues related to education in the ecosystem, from
three different aspects, and during the session we focus on recent advances and
existing and upcoming challenges.

- Materials: how are projects dealing with documentation and education
  materials
- Methods: What should we do to make our materials more accessible to
  underrepresented and/or historically marginalised groups?
- Tools: What are the existing tools in the ecosystem helping us achieve the
  above goals, and what do we need to develop?

#### DataFrame API & PyArrow Update
**Chair: Joris Van den Bossche**
**Time: <TBA>**

A small and short abstract.

If your organization is covering the expenses of an open source maintainer to
attend the conference, [let us know](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) and we
will list it here.
