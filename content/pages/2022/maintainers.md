## Maintainers
EuroSciPy aims to be the meeting point of maintainers of scientific open source
projects, with other contributors and their users.

### Maintainers Track

The maintainers track are informal sessions intended for discussions among
contributors.

Please [email](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) us if you have a proposal for
a maintainers session.

All the sessions will take place in the <TBA> room.

### Schedule

#### Scientific Python / SPECs
**Chair: Jarrod Millman**
**Time: <TBA>**

The [Scientific Python](https://scientific-python.org/) project aims to better
coordinate the ecosystem and grow the community. This session focuses on our
efforts to better coordinate project development, and to improve shared
infrastructure. In this session together we will discuss project goals and
recent technical work.

The Scientific Python project's vision is to help pave the way towards a
unified, expanded scientific Python community. It focuses its efforts along two
primary axes: _(i)_ to create a joint community around all scientific projects
and _(ii)_ to support maintainers by building cross-cutting technical
infrastructure and tools. In this session we mostly focus on the second aspect.

The project has already launched a process whereby projects can, voluntarily,
adopt reference guidelines; these are known as
[SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/) or Scientific Python Ecosystem
Coordination documents. SPECs are similar to projects specific guidelines like
PEPs, NEPs, SLEPs, and SKIPs, to name a few. The distinction being that SPECs
have a broader scope, targeted at all (or most) projects from the scientific
Python ecosystem.

The project also provides and maintains tools to help maintainers. This
includes a theme for the project websites (currently used on, e.g., numpy.org
and scipy.org), a self-hosted privacy-friendly web analytics platform, a
community discussions forum, a technical blog, and project development
statistics.

We present all these tools, discuss various upcoming SPECs, and highlight the
project's future potential.

The Scientific Python project is already supported by eight core projects:
IPython, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and
SciPy. The organization has spent the last several months working on the
infrastructure, and is now ready to engage more widely to help grow and support
the community.

#### Education - Materials, methods, tools
**Chair: Mx Chiin-Rui Tan (She/Her, They/Them)**
**Time: <TBA>**

This session focuses on issues related to education in the ecosystem, from
three different aspects, and during the session we focus on recent advances and
existing and upcoming challenges.

- Materials: how are projects dealing with documentation and education
  materials
- Methods: What should we do to make our materials more accessible to
  underrepresented and/or historically marginalised groups?
- Tools: What are the existing tools in the ecosystem helping us achieve the
  above goals, and what do we need to develop?

#### Interoperability in the DataFrame landscape: DataFrame API & PyArrow Update
**Chair: Joris Van den Bossche**
**Time: <TBA>**

In this session, we want to share some updates on the DataFrame ecosystem: the DataFrame
interchange protocol (https://data-apis.org/dataframe-protocol/latest/purpose_and_scope.html)
and Arrow C Data interface (https://arrow.apache.org/docs/format/CDataInterface.html),
and the integration of those interoperability protocols with different libraries. Further, we
want to have an open conversation about challenges and requirements related to DataFrame
interoperability and supporting multiple DataFrame libraries in projects.

#### Contributor Experience & Diversity
**Chair: Noa Tamir (She/Her, They/Them)**
**Time: <TBA>**

Most of us have been hearing about Diversity Equity and Inclusion (DEI) for some
years now, and even had access to many resources by now.
Our projects have codes of conduct, and some have been doing sprints and 
mentorships. But how much has fundamentally changed?

Letâ€™s meet for an honest conversation about the challenges of DEI actions, and 
culture change. How do we achieve long-term impact? What are low-hanging fruit? 
We can share hard-to-ask questions, effective tools, experiences that shaped our 
approach, and see if we can all nudge each other forward a little.

Inclusion happens at the community level, also when we want to address DEI 
itself. So, we will need to create a safe space for hard questions and leave 
judgment at the door.

Thanks to our grant to [advance an inclusive culture in the scientific Python 
ecosystem](https://figshare.com/articles/online_resource/Advancing_an_inclusive_culture_in_the_scientific_Python_ecosystem/16548063), we have created the contributor experience lead role. We have been 
working with NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas to learn how to integrate this 
new role to a project, and how to introduce contributor hospitality techniques. 
We are working on creating widely available resources, and we would benefit from 
hearing from maintainers from the wider community.

## Participating Projects
There is at least one confirmed maintainer from the following projects at the
conference:

If your organization is covering the expenses of an open source maintainer to
attend the conference, [let us know](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) and we
will list it here.
