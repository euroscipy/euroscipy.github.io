### How to come to Basel?

#### By Plane
[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg](https://www.euroairport.com/en) is an 
international airport in the French Alsace region. In the airport, after the baggage 
claim, you will find two exits: one to Switzerland through the Swiss custom check, 
the other to France/Germany through the EU custom check. 

To get to the city from the airport, take the Swiss exit. Right outside the building, 
you will find the bus 50 to the SBB train station going through the city. 

#### By Train
Basel has two train stations:  

1. [Basel SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/de/bahnhof-services/am-bahnhof/bahnhoefe/bahnhof-baselsbb.html) 
is the central train station of Basel served mainly by Swiss Federal Railways. 
To get to the conference venue from the SBB, take the tram 8, or tram 11, or bus 30.

2. Basel Badischer Bahnhof (Basel Bad Bhf), all long-distance and regional trains of Deutsche 
Bahn (DB) and Swiss Federal Railways between Germany and Switzerland stop here. 
To get to the venue from the Bad Bhf you can easily take tram 6 or bus 30. 

#### By Bus
There is a bus terminal right beside the Basel SBB train station for long-distance 
bus services like FlixBus. 

#### By Car
If you are coming by car, try to book a hotel with a parking place. Parking your 
car in the city can get rather expensive. For people with disability, you can park your 
car in the City Parkhaus which is the closest parking house to the venue. You 
can take the lift towards Petersplatz, the venue is then less than 100 meter away.

### How to get around in Basel?
The venue is right in the city center, you can walk around easily. Most places in 
Basel city can be reached by foot. 

#### Bus and Trams
There are many bus connections to reach any part of the city, as well as to the 
bordering German and French towns. 
Check the regional transportation within three countries corner [here](https://www.bvb.ch/en/). 

#### Rent an e-bike or e-Scooter
Basel can best be explored on two wheels. City is built on multiple hills, its is 
a wise decision to rent an e-bike. There are multiple organizations offering e-bike 
rentals, one is [pickebike](https://basel.pickebike.ch/en/).

You can also rent an electronic scooter to explore the city easily and in a fun way.
See info [here](https://whimapp.com/switzerland/en/e-scooters/).

### Hotels

in Switzerland or consider cheaper options in the bordering French or German towns.

#### Hotels in the Bordering Towns   

You can also consider booking accommodation in the bordering towns all of which 
have public transportation directly to the Basel city center and the venue. The 
border towns are literally connected to the Basel city.

a direct bus connection to the conference venue (bus 38), duration less than 20 min.
There is also a train station, one stop away from Basel Badischer Bahnhof.
We recommend [Hotel Eckert](https://www.eckert-grenzach.de/e/de.html) with a 
fantastic Michelin Star restaurant. There are a few other good hotels in this town.
- **St Louis:** a small French town on the border with cheap apartments and hotels. 
You can get to the venue directly with tram (tram 8) or bus (bus 604).
- **Lörrach:** the closest German city on the border. It has direct bus and train 
connections to Basel. This city has many hotels and other accomodation types. 
- **Weil am Rhine:** a small German town on the border to France with a direct tram 
connection to the Basel city center. It has the cheapest hotel options.   

### Activities   

Once in Basel, be like locals, try floating in the Rhine. [Swimming in the Rhine](https://www.basel.com/en/activities-excursions/swimming-rhine) 
is the most popular sport in summer. Bring your swimming suite, buy a Wickelfisch to 
put your belongings and float on. 

Like locals, try a relaxing mini picnic on the stairs by the Rhine river in the evenings.

Basel is known as the capital of art of Switzerland, it has many galleries and
museums. There is [El Greco exhibition](https://www.basel.com/en/events-calendar/picasso-el-greco-5703b97b33)
