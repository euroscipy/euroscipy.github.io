# Sprint

### Project sprint

A one-day sprint is organized on August 18. Open source sprints are session
where maintainers and contributors (including first time contributors) meet,
and work together in improving the open source projects. This can include bug
fixes, new features, improvements to the documentation and others.

The definitive schedule is not yet known and more sprints will be added when
they are proposed. If you want to propose a sprint, please send us a message to
<a href="mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org">maintainers@euroscipy.org</a> .
