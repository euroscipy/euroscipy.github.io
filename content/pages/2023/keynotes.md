# Keynotes

We are pleased to announce the following keynotes at EuroSciPy this year.

## Integrating Ethics in ML: From Philosophical Foundations to Practical Implementations {#keynote-1}

*Giada Pistilli - Hugging Face*

**Abstract:**

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Machine Learning (ML), significant
advancements like Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining critical importance
in both industrial and academic spheres. However, the rush towards deploying
advanced models harbors inherent ethical tensions and potential adverse
societal impacts. The keynote will start with a brief introduction to the
principles of ethics, viewed through the lens of philosophy, emphasizing how
these fundamental concepts find application within ML. Grounding our discussion
in tangible realities, we will delve into pertinent case studies, including the
BigScience open science initiative, elucidating the practical application of
ethical considerations. Additionally, the keynote will touch upon findings from
my recent research, which investigates the synergy between ethical charters,
legal tools, and technical documentation in the context of ML development and
deployment.

**Bio:**

Giada Pistilli is a philosophy researcher specializing in ethics applied to
Conversational AI. Her research is mainly focused on ethical frameworks, value
theory, applied and descriptive ethics. After obtaining a masterâ€™s degree in
ethics and political philosophy at Sorbonne University, she pursued her
doctoral research in the same faculty. Giada is also Principal Ethicist at
Hugging Face, where she conducts philosophical and interdisciplinary research
on AI Ethics and content moderation. Her publications, resume, and contact
information are available on [her website](https://www.giadapistilli.com/).

## Polars {#keynote-2}

*Ritchie Vink*

**Abstract:**

Polars is the "relatively" new fast dataframe implementation that redefines
what DataFrames are able to do on a single machine, both in regard with
performance and dataset size. In this talk we will dive into polars and see
what makes it so efficient. It will touch on technologies like Arrow, Rust,
parallelism, data structures, query optimization and more.

**Bio:**

Ritchie Vink is the author of the Polars DataFrame library and query engine. He
has been working as a software engineer and machine learning engineer for 8
years. Before he started polars, he did many side projects on varying topics in
computer science and statistics.
