## Maintainers

EuroSciPy aims to be the meeting point of maintainers of scientific open source
projects, with other contributors and their users.

### Maintainers Track

The maintainers track are informal sessions intended for discussions among
contributors.

Please [email](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) us if you have a proposal for
a maintainers session.

All the sessions will take place in the room HS119.

### Schedule

The final schedule is announced in the [Program](/2023/program_menu.html)
section of the website.

If you are a maintainer of a popular scientific Python project, and you are considering
joining EuroSciPy after the CFP is closed, please do get in touch at our
[maintainers email address](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) to see if we still
have a slot available for you to talk at the conference.

### Sprints

Open source projects will be sprinting at EuroSciPy on August 18th.

You can find more information about sprints in the [Sprint](/2023/sprint.html)
page.

Please [email](mailto:maintainers@euroscipy.org) us if you have a proposal for
a maintainers session.
