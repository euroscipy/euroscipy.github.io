## Code of conduct

The EuroSciPy conference benefits from a diverse community, which has grown
as a friendly, welcoming and dynamic group.

We trust that attendees will behave towards each other in a way that
reflects the view widely shared by this community, that diversity and
civility are strengths to be celebrated and fostered.

Furthermore, we believe that the conference will be more productive and
enjoyable for everyone if a professional atmosphere prevails, meaning
that all delegates may expect to

- be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
- be free from any form of discrimination, victimisation, harassment or bullying;
- enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behaviour, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.

If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact
EuroSciPy2023 code of conduct team or organizers directly or send an email to coc@euroscipy.org.

And in case of a conflict you can send an email to coi@python-verband.org.

Any complaint will remain confidential and will be investigated. The EuroSciPy
CoC team will do their best to resolve any conflict and preserve the
welcoming character of the conference. As a last resort, a participant
may be requested to leave the venue of the conference, without
reimbursement.

The members of the code of conduct team are:

- Alessia Marcolini
- Maren Westermann
- Mojdeh Rastgoo
- Konstantin Ignatov

Furthermore, participants are hereby reminded that they should abide by
the laws of the country hosting EuroSciPy, with discrimination and
harassment being against the law. Cases of law-breaking actions shall be
reported to the police.
