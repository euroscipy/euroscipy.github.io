### How to come to Basel?

#### By Plane
[EuroAirport Basel Mulhouse Freiburg](https://www.euroairport.com/en) is an
international airport in the French Alsace region. In the airport, after the baggage
claim, you will find two exits: one to Switzerland through the Swiss customs check,
the other to France/Germany through the EU customs check.

To get to the city from the airport, take the Swiss exit. Right outside the building,
you will find the bus 50 to the SBB train station going through the city.

#### By Train
Basel has two train stations: 

1. [Basel SBB](https://www.sbb.ch/de/bahnhof-services/am-bahnhof/bahnhoefe/bahnhof-baselsbb.html)
is the central train station of Basel served mainly by Swiss Federal Railways.
To get to the conference venue from the SBB, take tram 8, tram 11, or bus 30.

2. Basel Badischer Bahnhof (Basel Bad Bhf), all long-distance and regional trains of Deutsche
Bahn (DB) and Swiss Federal Railways between Germany and Switzerland stop here.
To get to the venue from the Bad Bhf, you can easily take tram 6 or bus 30.

#### By Bus
There is a bus terminal right beside the Basel SBB train station for long-distance
bus services like FlixBus.

#### By Car
If you are coming by car, try to book a hotel with a parking place. Parking your
car in the city can get rather expensive. For people with disability, you can park your
car in the City Parkhaus which is the closest parking house to the venue. You
can take the lift towards Petersplatz, the venue is then less than 100 meters away.

### How to get around in Basel?
The venue is right in the city center, you can walk around easily. Most places in
Basel city can be reached by foot.

#### Bus and Trams
There are many bus and tram connections to reach any part of the city, as well as to the
bordering German and French towns.
Check the regional transportation within three countries' corner [here](https://www.bvb.ch/en/).

#### Rent an e-bike or e-Scooter
Basel can best be explored on two wheels. The city is built on multiple hills, so it is
a wise decision to rent an e-bike. There are multiple organizations offering e-bike
rentals, one is [pickebike](https://basel.pickebike.ch/en/).

You can also rent an electronic scooter to explore the city easily and in a fun
way, see info [here](https://whimapp.com/switzerland/en/e-scooters/).

### Hotels
Since Basel is a border city, you can book hotels either in the Basel city center
in Switzerland or consider cheaper options in the bordering French or German towns.

#### Hotels in the Basel City
